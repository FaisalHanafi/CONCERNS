Cooking Course Registration System (ConCeRnS)

# Introduction
A project for the CSC 1100 Elements of Programming done by me (Faisal).
A simple registration system for One Cooking Course Academy is developed using C++.

# Intsruction
1) First things first, you will need to enter your choice of authentication, whether registering as a new user or logging in as an existing user.
2) To experience the full system, it is recommended that you register as a new user.
3) Then, choose between the courses offered.
4) Next, choose the preferred session of the course.
5) After that, the last input needed is the number of participants that are going to enter the course.
6) Lastly, the system will calculate the total charges, which will include goods and services tax (GST), which is equal to 6%.


# Future
Add a payment module.
